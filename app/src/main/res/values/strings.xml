        This app will determine your left, right and center channel.
        Plug your earphones and press the speaker icons. If your phone has stereo loud speakers like Moto G 2nd Gen, HTC M9 have,
         app will work perfectly fine however if it has only single loud speaker like Moto G 1st Gen , Samsung Galaxy S4 has , sorry
        you will listen same sound without any changes.
